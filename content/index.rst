Filip Sufitchi's Blog
===================================

This is a stanging area for building out a new (yet another) blog. It uses Sphinx [#f1]_ and reStructuredText for content management (static page generation), and is designed to be simple and easy to maintain. The blog itself is in essence just a collection of plaintext files, which can be edited with any text editor. The content is converted to HTML using Sphinx, and can be hosted on any static file server.

There's going to be more details here, fancier styling, etc... as I get around to it. For now, this is just a placeholder.
